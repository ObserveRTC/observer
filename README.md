Observer is an Open Source monitoring service for WebRTC applications. It is part of 
a solution ObserveRTC offers for developers. 

WebRTC applications integrated with [observer.js](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/integrations)
receive their [PeerConnection Samples](https://observertc.org/docs/references/peer-connection-sample/)
at this service. The `observer` service is capable of groupping them into call, and
forwarding [WebRTC-Observer](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/webrtc-observer) to
defined sinks (e.g.: kafka).

## Quick Start

You can deploy the service by using [docker](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/docker-webrtc-observer)
or [helm](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/helm).
To integrate `observer-js`, please visit the integration [guidline](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/integrations)

## Installation

Please read [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) instructions.

## Test

The service uses `gradle` to build and test.
To simply run tests: `gradle test`
