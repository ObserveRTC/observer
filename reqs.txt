1. No "traffic" within 6 hours. Successful peerConnections is probably the best proxy for traffic. This is meant to show if there is something seriously wrong with the system. (Vidhealth)
2. Concurrent streams on a single mediaUnit exceeds 100. This is mean to show where / when more capacity might be needed. (Vidhealth)
3. Average packet loss across all connections exceeds 5% for 60 seconds - this is meant to show a networking or server issue impacting users. (all)
4. RTT increased by more than 20% in a 2 hour window during normal "business hours" - this is meant to show a networking or server issue impacting users. Needs to be filtered in a way that a couple bad call in the middle of the night does not trigger the alert. (all)
5. Users with media errors increased more than 20% in a 1-hour window during normal "business hours". This is meant to show a JS config issue. (Meetaway)

1. traffics buckets for service/mediaunit -> receivedSamples
2. get concurrent streams for a specified address -> addressStats
3.
queries:
how many peer connection we have now?
how many concurrent stream is going through a specific address

mediaServerStats: A configured address, which will be watched, reported and queried.
